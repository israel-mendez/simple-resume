Project Name: SBA HTML/CSS/JS
Project Description:
This website is a work in progress and although I tried to complete all the requirements, I would have liked to do more with the project but was not able to due to lack of time. The website is built using HTML and CSS, and I have used DIVs to separate content in the HTML form. My aim was to get a dark, pleasant aesthetic that matched neo brutalist design patterns.

Normally, neo-brutalist designs would have included more cartoonish graphics and floating designed elements, however, due to the time constraints, I was not able to add these elements. On the next iteration of the website, I would like to use the space more efficiently and have a more uniform look.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work.

Installation:
No installation is required for this project as it is a simple HTML and CSS website.
